Proof of concept sketch for uploading files from RFduino over Bluetooth Low Energy.
 
Note that this is an abuse of Bluetooth low energy and probably a bad idea.

# RFduino

Load RFduinoFileUploader.ino onto your RFduino.
Put a log file, "sample.log" onto the SDcard. Start with a small file (less than 10 kb.)

# Phone

Works on iOS or Android with Cordova (PhoneGap)

    $ cordova platform add ios
    $ cordova plugin add com.megster.cordova.rfduino
    $ open platforms/ios/LogReader.xcodeproj
    
Use Xcode to deploy the code to your iPhone.
